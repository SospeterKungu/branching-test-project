# Branching Project

##Author

## Descriptions
  This is a project explaining branching. It demonstrates how we can have a copy of the original code, copy it into different branches and edit the branches separately, show the different branches to our customers and depending on which version of the project they want and choose, we merge this chosen branch to the original code and update it on our final project to be used. This also helps different developers develop different themes or items at the same time and later merge their most suitable version. It can also help a developer develop different versions himself to showcase to the clients before presenting to them for choosing and also enables us to add functions to our existing code for testing and debugging before being approved for the final upload.
